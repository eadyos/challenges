Pente is a game of stones played on a Go board.

Each player takes turns placing a stone on the board.
The objective is to place 5 of your stones in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

When a player has placed 4 open-ended stones in a row, they have nearly won the game, because the opposing player cannot block both ends on a single turn.

When a player has placed 3 open-ended stones in a row, they must be blocked or they can create a series of 4 stones on the next turn.

Assume that it is player two's turn.

Given a 15 Ã— 15 board, and the positions of player one and player two.
Return the coordinates where player two should place a stone to block player one.

A position that is under threat from having a 5th (winning) stone placed is a higher priority than blocking the placement of a 4th stone.

If a position is under threat to have a 4th stone placed from multiple directions, it is a higher priority than a position that is only under threat from one direction.

Edit (Additional clarification): Any given coordinate has a threat priority level that is defined as follows:

Coordinates under threat from a 5th stone.
If any coordinate is under threat from the placement of a 5th stone, then any threats due to the placement of a 4th stone do not matter.
Coordinates under threat from a 4th stone that would result in an open-ended sequence of 4 stones, from multiple directions. The more directions, the higher the priority. (Test case 6).
Coordinates under threat from a 4th stone that would result in an open-ended sequence of 4 stones from only 1 direction.
If no stones under threat = empty list.
Example 1
For playerOne = [[7,7], [7,8], [7,9], [10,9]] and playerTwo = [[0,0],[6,8], [8,7], [9,8]], the output should be
penter(playerOne, playerTwo) = [[7,6], [7,10]].

  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4
0 2 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
2 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

4 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
5 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
6 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 2 _ _ _ _ _ _
7 _ _ _ _ _ _ X 1 1 1 X _ _ _ _
8 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 2 _ _ _ _ _ _ _
9 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 2 _ _ _ _ _ _
0 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 _ _ _ _ _

2 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
3 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
4 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
Player one should be blocked at either position marked X.

For playerOne = [[7,8], [9,6], [10,5], [10,9]] and playerTwo = [[10,6], [10,7], [10,8]], the output should be
penter(playerOne, playerTwo) = [[6,9], [11,4]].

  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4

3 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

2 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
3 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
4 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
Player one should be blocked at position X.

The goal is to return the highest-priority block, if it exists.

(In the game of Pente, players can also capture opponent's stones if they enclose 2 of them, but this rule is ignored for the sake of challenge simplicity.)

Input/Output

[execution time limit] 6 seconds (groovy)

[input] array.array.integer playerOne

Player One's positions

[input] array.array.integer playerTwo

Player Two's positions

[output] array.array.integer

Highest threat positions or an empty list if no positions are under threat.
Coordinates should be returned in lexical order.
