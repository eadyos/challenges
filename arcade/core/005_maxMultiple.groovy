Given a divisor and a bound, find the largest integer N such that:

N is divisible by divisor.
N is less than or equal to bound.
N is greater than 0.
It is guaranteed that such a number exists.

Example

For divisor = 3 and bound = 10, the output should be
maxMultiple(divisor, bound) = 9.

The largest integer divisible by 3 and not larger than 10 is 9.

Input/Output

[time limit] 6000ms (groovy)
[input] integer divisor

Guaranteed constraints:
2 ≤ divisor ≤ 10.

[input] integer bound

Guaranteed constraints:
5 ≤ bound ≤ 100.

[output] integer

The largest integer not greater than bound that is divisible by divisor.
