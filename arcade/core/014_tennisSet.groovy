In tennis, a set is finished when one of the players wins 6 games and the other one wins less than 5, or, if both players win at least 5 games, until one of the players wins 7 games.

Determine if it is possible for a tennis set to be finished with the score score1 : score2.

Example

For score1 = 3 and score2 = 6, the output should be
tennisSet(score1, score2) = true.

For score1 = 8 and score2 = 5, the output should be
tennisSet(score1, score2) = false.

Since both players won at least 5 games, the set would've ended once one of them won the 7th one.

For score1 = 6 and score2 = 5, the output should be
tennisSet(score1, score2) = false.

Input/Output

[time limit] 6000ms (groovy)
[input] integer score1

Number of games won by the 1st player, non-negative integer.

Guaranteed constraints:
0 ≤ score1 ≤ 10.

[input] integer score2

Number of games won by the 2nd player, non-negative integer.

Guaranteed constraints:
0 ≤ score2 ≤ 10.

[output] boolean

true if score1 : score2 represents a possible score for an ended set, false otherwise.
