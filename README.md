# Codefights

This repo contains solutions to problems I've worked on at [codefights.com](https://codefights.com/)

CodeFights is a good resource for practicing your coding skills.


## Challenges

Challenges are daily challenges where you compete with 3 goals.

**1) Solve the problem by passing all test cases and hidden test cases.**

You are not shown all the test cases, so it is difficult to cheat. 

**2) Solve the problem within the given time constraints.**

At first glace, a problem can look trivial, but getting a solution to complete within the given time constraints can require efficiency that is orders of magnitude faster than a trivial solution.  LogN, or N time vs N^2 for example.

**3) Solve the problem using as little characters as possible.**

This is commonly referred to as "code golf".  It can result in horribly uglified code, but as a learning exercise it has merit.  Coming up with a solution and then "golfing" it down to fewer characters exposes you to capabilities of a programming language that you may not have known.  Here, you are competing with other programmers.


## Arcade

The arcade is a fixed set of problems under topic sections.  The problems in a section can have an increasing level of difficulty the further you go.

While there are 1) test cases and 2) time constraints, there are no awards for shortest-solution in the arcade.  Code written for the arcade is generally more **readable** than what is written for "Challenges", however, bear in mind that it is still written just for practice with no audience in mind.


## Practice

The practice section are problems that can have subtle, yet steep difficulty.  In this section, its not enough to just return the correct result, but you must also do it with strict O(n) performance and memory constraints. They are the types of questions that are often asked in an interview setting.
